i am edit library - i edit clojure code

i do form selection and when editing program asks me "select current form at cursor", i give back a zipper or string, "move current form into the upper one" - new state of doc that can be applied to the underlying doc
i do formatting as we type 
i do color tokens, brackets as data decribing the document
i have no git history - my source files define me
i accept no github pull requests - i have no public programmers
